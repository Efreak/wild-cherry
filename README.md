* In order for this theme to render correctly, you will need a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).

**Activating...**

1. Move `zsh/wild-cherry.zsh-theme` file to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/)'s theme folder: `oh-my-zsh/themes/wild-cherry`.
2. Go to your `~/.zshrc` file and set `ZSH_THEME="wild-cherry"`. Finally, reload your terminal.
